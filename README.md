## Installation and configuration

If you want to try a project, download it then use the command below in terminal to install

````
npm i
````
&nbsp;


An additional task will be to create the `apiKeys.js` file in the `./src` folder. The file should have the following structure:

````
const YOUTUBE_API_KEY = 'yourAPIKey';
const VIMEO_API_KEY = 'yourAPIKey';

export { YOUTUBE_API_KEY, VIMEO_API_KEY };
````


If you don't know how to generate a token, see this links: [youtube](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) , [vimeo](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/guides/start)

&nbsp;

To start the development mode use command below:

````
npm start
````
&nbsp;


## Solutions

- **React Portals** - I decided on this solution because I wanted the modal to be an independent component, always appearing above other components.
- **React Reducer** - This solution is used in two cases: the fetch state and videos state handlers. It allowed me to better manage the state logic and optimize the performance of the components that run deep updates, because instead of passing callback functions I only use dispatch.
- **React Context** - In order to avoid prop drilling.
- **React Memo** - I used this in conjunction with context to avoid costly computation on every render.
